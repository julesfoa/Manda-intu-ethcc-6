Manda Swap System enables DAOs to trade anything with anyone in a decentralized market that is currently booming at around $80B, including: multisig, DAOs, and tokenized markets. DAOs and internet-powered organizations have the potential to become the new standard for business organization. To give DAOs a competitive edge, Decentralized Organizations need to perform complex operations more efficiently, such as trading illiquid assets. However, the complexity and high cost of these operations’ present challenges in planning, development, and auditing.

Manda Swap System acts as a neutral third party to ensure trust. Designed for operations involving multiple actors, this reusable and scalable solution assures trustless transactions. The escrow system empowers DAOs to carry out operations that were previously avoided, opening a world of opportunities, including purchasing illiquid assets, diversifying treasuries with swaps, consolidating with DAO mergers, or executing any OTC operation.

Manda is developing a decentralized escrow powered by Intu dEOAs. The participants set up an Intu multisig, pool funds from both parties, perform due diligence, and then execute the operation. The operation's success or termination is determined at this stage.
Manda Swap System enables an important cost optimisation and decrease the need of complex unique smart contract to execute DAO operations.


**Here is a guide to execute a Swap:**

**Step 1:** Create a Swap request
Specify the two ERC20 addresses to be swapped: 
AAVE: 0x50354…
BAL: 0x447603…
Specify the trader's address you want to trade with: 
AAVE Treasury (Initiator)
BAL Treasury (Receiver)
Behind the scenes: 
The Vault is created.
The Users pre-register.

**Step 2:** Setting up a Swap environment
Each user is required to sign the transactions to set up the Vault.

**Step 3:** Fund the Vault
Each user will sign allowance contracts that allow the volt to spend tokens being traded on behalf of users.

**Step 4:**
Swap: All users sign the transaction that will perform the swap (i.e., distribute the funds).
Ragequit: If a user rage quits, they cancel the spending allowance given to the Vault. 
The Vault Allowance is revoked for extra security.

Manda's journey is just beginning, aiming to perform the most complex operations for Decentralized organizations with different pure players of the ecosystem. The first step, in Q3 2023, is to find partners to plan and execute custom operations: Detokenization, DAO M&A, DAO-DAO Swap. The second step, in Q4 2023, is to deploy the Manda Swap system in a permissionless way to enable anyone to launch a Swap. Finally, Manda aims to adapt its swap system for various DAO standards. The goal is to expand to all actors managing digital asset in the next years.

The team is composed of crypto natives and research-driven builders. The three founders include Rani, a quantitative and Blockchain researcher graduated from McGill in Math; Joseph, a Full-stack and blockchain developer graduated from McGill in Computer Science; and Jules, a business developer and founder of Kryptosphere accelerator, graduating from emlyon Business School.
